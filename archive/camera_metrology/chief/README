- This is a dummy server. It accepts both text input and TCP/IP input on port
3001. 
- The sever has a standard "main.cpp" program that has a singleton object
which is the Server
- The Server includes the possibility of initialisation, shut-down, background
tasks and commands.
- Each command is defined as a function like Cmd_exit, which 
is included in the prototype object.
- The Makefile turns these into an input dictionary, and also creates
the help text from comment lines in the code in a standard format.
- Clearly, some inheritance is missing here for neatness. However, this
should be enough to make a start. Low level functionality should 
be implemented in another class that the Serve has an instance of.
